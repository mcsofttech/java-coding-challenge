java coding challenge
This code needs jdk 1.8
MainClass has the main method, I basically just right click and hit Run As > Java Application
Make sure you have the Console open
on the Console, it will ask how many numbers you want to enter
For example, you enter 5
then it will ask if you want to sort ascending or descending, 
enter 1 if you want to sort in ascending order, enter anything other than 1 will sort in dscending order
then enter 5 number respectively.

Then it will display a sorted list, number of occurence list, and number of unique values.
